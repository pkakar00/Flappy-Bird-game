# Flappy-Bird-game
This is a javascript based game that uses canvas for drawing multiple objects on the screen. The game involves a bird that is supposed to be saved from the incoming bars.
Pressing the spacebar makes the bird rise, else the bird falls. Pressing the + button increases the gravity of the bird and - key decreases the it.
Please feel free to improve the game provide me your suggestions. This game was a part of my class project.
